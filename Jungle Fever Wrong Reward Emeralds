Hello,

Today I finished the quest Jungle Fever. When I got the reward, I already have 2 Le in my inventory. Then instead of taking the quest Le and giving me one Le. He changed the original 2 Le I had into quest Items and gave me 1 Le, but I can't spend or use the quest Le. Is there anyway that I can get my original Emeralds back?
